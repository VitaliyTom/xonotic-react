# ***[Xonotic-react](https://xonotic-react.netlify.app)***

## This application was developed using "create-react-app" for the game **"[Xonotic](https://xonotic.org/)"**

### In this application, there are three servers to choose from. This application shows the name of the server, the server address, the maximum and total number of players, the name and image of the map on which the players are currently playing. you can also see who is currently in the game, who is watching, who is playing and in which team. Each player has a ping and a score.

### There are no commands on the "Relaxed Running" server - you can see who is watching and who is playing

### Data is updated every 15 seconds. To my regret, the API was **`not stable`**. Therefore, if it did not load within a minute, try refreshing the page or come back later.
